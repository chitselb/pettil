title: About WORD

Here's a word or two about word.  Word is a painfully overloaded word in Forth.  It can mean a Forth routine (e.g. "CMOVE is a word that copies memory") or 16 bits of data (e.g. "Push a word on the data stack") or a blank delimited sequence of characters (e.g. "The word WORD parses a word from the input stream").  I'm really very sorry about that.  If you can't make out which meaning of word from context, try rereading that passage several times.  Word!
