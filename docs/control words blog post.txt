I’m rewriting the control keywords, **IF THEN ELSE DO ?DO LEAVE ?LEAVE LOOP +LOOP BEGIN WHILE REPEAT UNTIL AGAIN** .  Everything was fine, but then one day I was sad because I couldn’t do something in my application code  without triggering a compilation error.  It might have been putting **LEAVE** inside an **IF** **THEN** block?  I don't remember.  But I remember feeling that a rewrite was in order.

Originally I lifted the PETTIL control structure code wholesale from Blazin’ Forth.  It might have been necessary to change the branches from 16-bit addresses to 8-bit signed offsets, but otherwise I just plugged the Blazin' code in without modification.

I am very happy that the replacement code takes up less space than the old compiler code, from 627 bytes before down to only 585 bytes now! A few cool tricks were used.

*   Branching out of **DO **loops is handled by pushing the address following **LOOP** to the return stack. When the **_index _**reaches the _**limit** _a word called **UNLOOP** takes care of unnesting the outer loop, and transfer of control is a simple call to **EXIT**.

*   While I was in there, I renamed a byte of zero page storage from **xsave** to **z**&nbsp;. &nbsp;It was being used mostly to save the **X**&nbsp;register data stack pointer so that a primitive could use instructions requiring the **X **register. &nbsp;Calling it **z**&nbsp;makes it seem more like a pseudo-accumulator (the&nbsp;‘**Z**’** **register)
*   I added a **3ERASE** primitive to zero three consecutive bytes of memory.
*   Instead of using **?PAIRS**&nbsp;to create and validate control words, I allocated three bytes of memory, one for each _family_**&nbsp;**of words, e.g. **IF THEN ELSE**&nbsp;is in family 2. &nbsp;Opening a structure (**IF**) increments counter 2, **ELSE **will first decrement and then increment counter 2, and **THEN**&nbsp;will decrement it. &nbsp;Nesting is okay, but if the counter ever goes negative, an error condition exists. &nbsp;It also permits things like **IF LEAVE THEN**&nbsp;(which should be abbreviated to its equivalent&nbsp;**?LEAVE**)
