title: PETTIL packet map

!!Diagram illustrating storage of data and screen blocks

Forth blocks are 1024 bytes.  At 40x25 characters, the PET screen is a mismatch
for the Forth block, coming up 24 bytes short.  Traditionally, Forth blocks
are edited in screen-sized units, and the PET has (in my opinion) the best 
native editing capabilities of any of the three machines in the [["class of '77"|http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/298]]

My solution was metadata.  Packets have two flags.  The "writable?" flag 
is true if this packet is an editor packet.  Screens are editable (WRITABLE? = true).  Data blocks
are not.  Data blocks will be displayed by the screen editor (except for the
last 24 bytes) but when leaving the screen, the editor will not update the
packet for uneditable blocks. Data blocks can be converted to screens by the 
STOP-CLR editor command

The other flag is "uncompressed?" (usually false) which indicates if this
packet is RLE-encoded or merely stored.  Packets are stored in situations where

* the programmer does not want to [[RLENCODE]] or [[RLDECODE]] them
* the [[encoder|RLENCODE]] detects that "negative compression" would occur
 
Packet data is 0..1024 bytes of data

Packet headers consist of the total packet size ("size") ORed with the
"uncompressed?" and "writable?" flags
