title: logical lines

The native PET screen editor uses //logical lines// of 40 or 80 columns each, and PETTIL source screens are composed of such 40 or 80 column lines (min 13; max 25). Code in the editor may extend to the very last column of a logical line.  The line ending between the last column and the first column of the next line is treated as whitespace by the compiler.
