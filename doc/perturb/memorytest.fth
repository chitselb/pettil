\ Version 0.7 1 April 2012  Tests placed in the public domain.
\         0.6 30 January 2011 CHECKMEM modified to work with ttester.fs
\         0.5 30 November 2009 <false> replaced with FALSE
\         0.4 9 March 2009 Aligned test improved and data space pointer tested
\         0.3 6 March 2009 { and } replaced with T{ and }T
\         0.2 20 April 2007  ANS Forth words changed to upper case
\         0.1 October 2006 First version released

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ The tests are based on John Hayes test program for the core word set
\ and requires those files to have been loaded

\ Words tested in this file are:
\     ALLOCATE FREE RESIZE
\     
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Assumptions and dependencies:
\     - that 'addr -1 ALLOCATE' and 'addr -1 RESIZE' will return an error
\     - tester.fr or ttester.fs has been loaded prior to this file
\     - testing FREE failing is not done as it is likely to crash the
\       system

TESTING ALLOCATE FREE RESIZE

VARIABLE addr1
VARIABLE datsp

HERE datsp !
T{ 100 ALLOCATE SWAP addr1 ! -> 0 }T
T{ addr1 @ ALIGNED -> addr1 @ }T   \ Test address is aligned
T{ HERE -> datsp @ }T            \ Check data space pointer is unchanged
T{ addr1 @ FREE -> 0 }T

T{ 99 ALLOCATE SWAP addr1 ! -> 0 }T
T{ addr1 @ ALIGNED -> addr1 @ }T
T{ addr1 @ FREE -> 0 }T

T{ 50 ALLOCATE SWAP addr1 ! -> 0 }T

: writemem 0 DO I 1+ OVER C! 1+ LOOP DROP ;	( ad n -- )

\ checkmem is defined this way to maintain compatibility with both
\ tester.fr and ttester.fs which differ in their definitions of T{

TESTING failure of RESIZE and ALLOCATE (unlikely to be enough memory)

T{ addr1 @ FREE -> 0 }T

T{ -1 ALLOCATE SWAP DROP 0= -> FALSE }T		\ Memory allocate failed
