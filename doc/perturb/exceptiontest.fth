\ Version 0.4 1 April 2012  Tests placed in the public domain.
\         0.3 6 March 2009 { and } replaced with T{ and }T
\         0.2 20 April 2007 ANS Forth words changed to upper case
\         0.1 Oct 2006 First version released

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ The tests are based on John Hayes test program for the core word set
\
\ Words tested in this file are:
\     CATCH THROW ABORT ABORT"
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Assumptions and dependencies:
\     - the forth system under test throws an exception with throw
\       code -13 for a word not found by the text interpreter. The
\       undefined word used is $$qweqweqwert$$,  if this happens to be
\       a valid word in your system change the definition of t7 below
\     - tester.fr or ttester.fs has been loaded prior to this file
\     - CASE, OF, ENDOF and ENDCASE from the core extension wordset
\       are present and work correctly

TESTING CATCH THROW

: t3 7 8 9 99 THROW ;
: c3 1 2 ['] t3 CATCH ;

	DEPTH >R DROP 2DROP 2DROP R> ;	\ after stack has been emptied

TESTING ABORT ABORT"

: t6 ABORT ;

\ The 77 in t10 is necessary for the second ABORT" test as the data stack
\ is restored to a depth of 2 when THROW is executed. The 77 ensures the top
\ of stack value is known for the results check
